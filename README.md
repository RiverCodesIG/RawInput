## Deprecation Notice
Moonsworth, LLC decided to pay their Indian developers this week, and we finally got raw input offically.
> Note: I'll likely revive this when Weave starts supporting multiple clients.

## Raw Input
Directly handles input from the mouse.

### Features
- Works with Windows, Linux, and Mac!
- Supports multiple mice.
- ~~Automatically adds new mice.~~ (broken, please help)
- Removes Lunar Client's polling rate notification.
